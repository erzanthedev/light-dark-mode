# Light and Dark Mode Toggle 🌞🌜

Welcome to the Light and Dark Mode Toggle project!
This application allows users to switch between light and dark modes for a better viewing experience based on their preferences.
The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, combining modern web technologies to deliver a smooth and interactive user experience.

## How It Works ⚙️

1. **Template Ready**: The project includes pre-built templates with CSS styling and necessary links in the HTML head tag, allowing for a faster build and more focus on functionality.
2. **Mode Switching**: Functions are used to switch between light and dark modes.
3. **Event Listeners**: Event listeners are set up to listen for changes on the toggle button.
4. **DOM Manipulation**: Variables are used for efficient DOM manipulation.
5. **Local Storage**: The local storage method is used to keep track of the mode selected by the user, ensuring their preference is saved and applied on subsequent visits.

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- **HTML**: For structuring the application layout.
- **CSS**: For styling the application in both light and dark modes.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity and handling the mode toggle functionality.
